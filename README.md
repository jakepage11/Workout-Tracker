# Workout Tracker
### Overview
A web application that allows each user to create their own workouts, track in-workout progress, and view progress towards goals.
### Implementation
Used NextJS as the front-end framework and combined the MongoDB Atlas API and database to store user workout information. Deployed
the application uses Netlify along with its Functions and Identity components to keep track of account information (usernames and passwords) as well as
ensure authentication and authorization for viewing specific information.
